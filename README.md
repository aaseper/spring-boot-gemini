## 2 Description

This repository features a Spring Boot application integrating the Google Gemini API for invoice data extraction. It demonstrates a flow: upload an invoice via HTTP, send its content to Gemini, process the returned JSON data, and map it to a Java DTO. This serves as a practical example for developers leveraging Gemini for document understanding in Spring Boot.
